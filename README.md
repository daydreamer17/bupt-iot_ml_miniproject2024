# bupt-iot_ml_miniproject2024
-*project background*:mini-project considers the problem of predicting whether a narrated story is true or not. Specifically, you will build a machine learning model that takes as an input an audio recording of **3-5 minutes** of duration and predicts whether the story being narrated is **true or not**. 
-*dataset we use*:A total of 100 samples consisting of a complete audio recording, a *Language* attribute and a *Story Type* attribute have been made available for you to build your machine learning model. The audio recordings can be downloaded from:

https://github.com/CBU5201Datasets/Deception

A CSV file recording the *Language* attribute and *Story Type* of each audio file can be downloaded from:
